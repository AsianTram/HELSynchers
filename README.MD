# HELSynchers

This is the practice project site for the FreeCodeCamp coders of Helsinki. Through this site, participants will gain experience and even be able list it in their portfolio. If you're to gain experience coding or even learn how to do things the professional way, come join us. It doesn't matter if you've coded before or not. You're welcome either way. Tervetuloa!

## Contributing
Yes, we'd love to have you in person, but Helsinki may be a long ways away for you. That doesn't mean you can't contribute and be recognized in the credits. Below are 7 steps to follow if you wish to contribute:

1) Fork the project to your own account
2) Clone it to your local machine
3) Create a branch (Our practice is to append feature/ for new features or bug/ for bug fixes. For example, if you are working on a new page for the site, let's call it contact.html for example, then you would create a branch called feature/contact_html).
```git
git branch feature/somefile_ext
git checkout feature/somefile_ext
```
4) Add,commit and push the files to your repo
```git
git add .
git commit -m 'contact.html done!'
git push
```
5) Submit a Pull Request
6) Once the Pull Request has been accepted delete the branch from the repo and your local machine
```git
git branch -d feature/somefile_ext
```
7) Rinse, dry, repeat!
